### **Code Explanation**

This project uses Python with the **YOLOv8 model** (via the `ultralytics` library) and **OpenCV** to detect human postures like Standing, Sitting, and Falling in images, videos, and real-time webcam feeds.

---

#### **1. Import Libraries**
```python
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
```
- `cv2` is used for image and video processing (OpenCV).
- `YOLO` is imported from the Ultralytics library to load and run the trained object detection model.

---

#### **2. Load the Trained Model**
```python
model = YOLO('best.pt')
```
- This line loads the trained model file (`best.pt`) which was created after training the dataset on Roboflow and YOLOv8.

---

#### **3. Define Class Labels**
```python
classnames = ["Fall", "Sitting", "Falling", "Standing"]
```
- These are the names of the posture classes that the model is trained to recognize.

---

#### **4. Set the Input Source**
```python
input_source = None
```
- This variable controls what the model processes:
  - `None` means it will use the webcam.
  - You can change it to a video path (e.g., `'video.mp4'`) or image path (e.g., `'photo.jpg'`).

---

#### **5. Frame Processing Function**
```python
def process_frame(frame):
```
- This function takes each image/frame and:
  - Runs YOLOv8 detection.
  - Draws bounding boxes with different colors for “Fall” and other classes.
  - Adds class names and confidence scores.
  - Alerts (prints a warning) when a fall is detected.

---

#### **6. Processing Video or Image**
```python
if input_source:
```
- If an image or video file is set, it opens and processes that.
- For video:
  - It reads frame-by-frame.
  - Displays the detection in real-time.
- For image:
  - It processes and shows the image once.

---

#### **7. Webcam Mode**
```python
else:  # Webcam Mode
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
```
- If no file is provided, the webcam is activated.
- It captures video from the camera and runs detection on each frame in real-time.
- Press `q` to exit the camera window.

---

#### **8. Close All Windows**
```python
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
- After the detection ends, this closes all OpenCV display windows.
